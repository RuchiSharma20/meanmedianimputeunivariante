# Titanic Dataset Mean Median Impute Univariate

## Overview
In this project, we utilize the Titanic toy dataset to demonstrate the implementation of mean median impute univariate technique. This approach is commonly used in data preprocessing to handle missing values by replacing them with either the mean or median of the respective feature.

## Dataset
The Titanic dataset is a classic dataset used in machine learning and data science tutorials. It contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including details such as age, sex, ticket class, and survival status.

## Implementation
We employ the mean median impute univariate technique to handle missing values within the Titanic dataset. This involves calculating the mean or median of each feature with missing values and replacing those missing values with the calculated statistic. By doing so, we ensure that the dataset is ready for further analysis and modeling.

## Usage
To replicate the process or explore the implementation, simply clone or download this repository and execute the provided scripts. Feel free to modify and adapt the code to suit your specific requirements or datasets.
